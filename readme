================================
Manual Run (Without Docker)

Start MongoDB locally.

Start listener:

cd listener
npm install
node listener.js

Start emitter:

cd emitter
npm install
node emitter.js

Start frontend:

cd frontend
npm install
node server.js


Notes

The listener silently discards invalid or corrupted payloads.

MongoDB uses a time-series collection with timestamp as the time field.

Batches are emitted every 10 seconds.

The system is intentionally simple to show encryption, validation, and streaming flow.
